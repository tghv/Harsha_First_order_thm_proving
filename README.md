Prediction of  proof out of 5 Heuristics for any given theorem of First Order Logic. Sixth heuristic is able to decline proof attempts which achieves a signiﬁcant reduction in total time required and reduction in the number of theorems proved.Aim is to demonstrate that sufﬁcient information is available from simple feature measurements of a conjecture and axioms to determine a good choice of heuristic, and that the choice process can be automatically learned. Selecting from a set of 5 heuristics, the learned results are better than any single heuristic. One version of the system is able to decline proof attempts. This achieves a signiﬁcant reduction in total time required.
